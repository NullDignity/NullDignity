### Hi there, I'm Dignity! 👋

🖥️ My love for coding and programming in general begun very early, when I first got in touch with Scratch in grade school. Today, I am an active learner of many programming languages, whether they are for web or application development, as I try to discover which field best suits me.

👨‍💻 I have experience with the development of basic desktop applications for my own personal, as well as academic use, as well as the development of simple but functional sites as group projects with friends. I also have experience with IT, whether it is maintaining and setting up computers for friends, utilizing cloud servers to host various projects (such as bots for Discord), preferably through a Linux environment.

🌌 Nowadays, I'm just creating projects for my own personal use, and to hone my skills further. That's pretty much it about me, thanks for reading!
